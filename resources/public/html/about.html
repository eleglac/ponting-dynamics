            <p>Welcome to my personal web page.  While a bit Spartan at the moment, I plan to continue developing the site as a way of augmenting my web programming ability.</p>
            <p>Most likely you are here because you are my friend and I wanted to show off for you.  Thank you for your support!</p>
            <p>Some interesting statistics about this project may be found  <a href="/statistics">here.</a>  A basic Javascript game can be found <a href="/js">here.</a></p>
            <p>If you need to contact me, I can be reached at <b>alex@pontingdynamics.org</b>.  I will try to get back to you as soon as possible.</p>
